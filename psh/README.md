# psh

The executable command line front-end of the `psh` engine. 

This crate contains the code behind the binary executable of the `psh`
interactive shell. The REPL, input reading, syntax highlighting, and everything
else used in the interactive shell lives here.

For more information about the shell, please see the [README](../README.md) in
the project root.
